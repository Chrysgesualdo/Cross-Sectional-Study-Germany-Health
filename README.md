## Summary

In this project, I investigated how environmental factors influence health behaviors among freshmen during COVID-19. Using a cross-sectional survey with 208 students, I analyzed the impact of social ties and living arrangements on physical activity, eating, and alcohol use. Data analysis with SPSS included t-tests, chi-square, ANCOVA, and regression analyses. The study highlighted the significant role of partners and peers in shaping health behaviors, especially alcohol use.
